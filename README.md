## Usage

To use this tool via `npx` directly from GitHub, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx github:AwesomeC-LC/playwright-lite-mcp
```

When you run this command for the first time, it will automatically download the necessary Chromium browser binaries using Playwright's `postinstall` script. This ensures that the tool has the required browser to perform automation tasks.

**Note:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
